# LatexGloves
My works (documents) made with Latex (SSU subject: CSIT)

Just so you know, I think it'd be better if you install TexLive (or MacTex) and work in Visual Studio Code. 
I wasted too many time fixing problems with MikTex installed on my MacOS system... and also deleting this. 
Pro Tip: to see how much do your files weight use terminal and program called "ncdu" ("brew install ncdu" to install)
