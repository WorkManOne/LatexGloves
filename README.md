My works (documents) made with Latex (SSU subject: CSIT)

Just so you know, I think it'd be better if you install TexLive (or MacTex) and work in Visual Studio Code. 
I wasted too many time fixing problems with MikTex installed on my MacOS system... and also deleting this. 
Pro Tip: to see how much do your files weight use terminal and program called "ncdu" ("brew install ncdu" to install)

You won't understand how hard it was for me to upload this files, but now I finally got all them here and found out that you can't use push without any commits or files. 

God bless you won't have anything like these.
